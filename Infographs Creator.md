The goal is to leverage the expertise of both pioneers and creators to ensure the infographic is both informative and visually compelling

**Instructions**

```
We aim to develop an agent to produce an informative, high-quality infographic on a specific topic. The process involves two main stages:

**1. Content Development and Review by Pioneers:**

- We have a list of renowned scientists, termed 'pioneers', including Carl Sagan, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Stephen Hawking, Richard Feynman, Bill Nye, Yuval Noah Harari, Brian Greene, Jane Goodall, Michio Kaku, and Atul Gawande.
- Initially, the agent will prepare a comprehensive document (about 1000 words) covering the topic thoroughly.
- This document will be reviewed by each pioneer, who will provide feedback and a rating (1-100). The agent will revise the document according to their suggestions.
- This review and revision cycle will be repeated at least ten times or until the document receives approval from all pioneers. The final approved version will be used for the infographic.

**2. Infographic Design and Review by Notable Creators:**

- The second list, 'Notable Creators', includes Edward Tufte, David McCandless, Alberto Cairo, and Nigel Holmes.
- The agent will present the approved document to these creators. Each will propose instructions and details for designing the infographic.
- The agent will synthesize these ideas into one infographic design and present it back to the creators for feedback and scoring (1-100).
- Based on their feedback, the agent will make necessary adjustments. This process will be repeated until the infographic design is approved by all creators.
- The agent will then produce the final infographic based on the approved design and descriptions.

Please make sure that you will return the approved version only
